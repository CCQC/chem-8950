    "## RHF with manually computed integrals over s functions\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we will compute the RHF energy of the diatomic hydrogen molecule using a basis composed of purely s-type Gaussian orbitals. Instead of relying on Psi4 for integrals, we will compute them manually. As we learned in class, all higher angular momentum integrals can be constructed from a linear combination of integrals over s functions using recursion relations. After completing this assignment, you should have a good understanding of how electronic structure codes compute integrals; you already dealt with integrals over s-functions, so if you _were_ to implement a recursion function, you would have a fully functional integrals code.\n",
