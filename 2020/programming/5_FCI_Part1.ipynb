    "## Bitwise Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "At the heart of bit manipulation are the bitwise operators & (and), | (or), ~ (not) and ^ (xor).  The first three you should already be familiar with in their boolean forms (&&, || and !). As a reminder, here are the truth tables:\n",
    "\n",
    "| A | B | !A | A && B | A \\|\\| B | A^B |\n",
    "|---|---|----|--------|----------|-----|\n",
    "| 0 | 0 | 1  | 0      | 0        | 0   |\n",
    "| 0 | 1 | 1  | 0      | 1        | 1   |\n",
    "| 1 | 0 | 0  | 0      | 1        | 1   |\n",
    "| 1 | 1 | 0  | 1      | 1        | 0   |\n",
    "\n",
    "The bitwise versions of the operations are the same, except that instead of interpreting their arguments as true or false, they operate on each bit of the argument. Thus, if A is 1010 and B is 1100, then\n",
    "\n",
    "* `A & B` = 1000\n",
    "* `A | B` = 1110\n",
    "* `A ^ B` = 0110\n",
    "* `~A` = 11110101 (the number of 1's depends on the datatype of A)\n",
    "\n",
    "The other two operators we will need are the shift operators `a << b` and `a >> b`. The former shifts all the bits in `a` to the left by `b` positions; the latter does the same but shifts right. For non-negative values (which are the only ones we're interested in), the newly exposed bits are filled with zeros. You can think of left-shifting by `b` as multiplications by `2b` and right-shifting as integer division by `2b`. The most common use for shifting is to access a particular bit, for example, `1 << x` is a binary number with bit `x` set and the others clear.\n",
    "\n",
    "| bits     | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "|----------|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n",
    "| position | 7 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 0 |\n",
    "| value    |128| 64| 32| 16| 8 | 4 | 2 | 1 |\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, we will use an integer to represent set, with a 1 bit representing a member that is present and a 0 bit when that is absent. Then the following operations are quite straightforward:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Set union `A | B`\n",
    "* Set intersection `A & B`\n",
    "* Set substraction `A & ~B`\n",
    "* Set bit `A |= 1 << bit`\n",
    "* Clear bit `A &= ~(1 << bit)`\n",
    "* Test bit `(A & 1 << bit) != 0`\n"
